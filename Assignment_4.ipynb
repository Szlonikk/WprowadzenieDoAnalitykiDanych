      "* Buttons vs Best Bottoms reviewFirst thing I want to mention  Best Bottoms inserts are compatible with Buttons diapers  LOVE this because I prefer hemp inserts and Buttons have not made a hemp insert yet  Speaking of inserts I prefer Best Bottoms inserts over Buttons inserts  the Buttons inserts bunch up more than Best Bottoms doDouble gusset awesomenessButtons covers 2 layer PUL just like Best Bottoms are SO soft even though they are thicker and more durable than 1 layer PUL covers  Best Bottoms are also 2 layer but are much stiffer and noisier  if you pat babys bottom with Best Bottoms on its loud I know that sounds like a silly thing to rate a diaper on but I much prefer my diaper options to be more discretequietButtons covers are slightly stretchy whereas Best Bottoms arent for the most part so I feel like I get a better fit with ButtonsButtons covers are less bulky than Best Bottoms  this says a lot because Best Bottoms are some of the trimmest diaper systems out there  Buttons is even trimmer I think due to the fabric being just that much softermoldableButtons covers seem to last longer than Best Bottoms  I have a Best Bottoms cover that I purchased the exact same time as a Buttons cover  the elastic in the Best Bottoms cover has relaxed while the Buttons cover still looks like newOne of the hip snaps on one of my Buttons covers is starting to lose its snapping capability however my baby has an unusually trim waist and weve been using the same hip snap since she was 6wks old she is now 8 months old  I just use other snaps so while slightly irritating its not that big of a deal at this point as I know we wont be using that snap much longer anyway  I havent contacted Buttons yet about possibly replacing the snap  I would like to replace it since I plan on selling these once she is potty trained  On this same cover there is also a small tear on the PUL on the inside of the diaper at a snap that holds an insert this tear happened within a couple months of purchase  Doesnt cause any leaks since this is a 2 layer PUL and the tear is basically under the snap  you can only see it when unsnapping an insert  I do not have any tears in the PUL on the Best Bottoms diapers so Best Bottoms PUL may be more durable  I still prefer Buttons and still consider them a 5 star cover  My other Buttons covers are slightly newer but have had no issues with them in the months Ive used them and believe this is an isolated problem with just the one coverI have this in Pebble probably my favorite Green not apple White Light Blue and Purple my other favorite  I really wish they had their original colors still available  the new colors are cute but I wish I had bought Strawberry when I had the chance it was so prettyWe rarely have leaks but I have noticed we leak more with Buttons than with Best Bottoms prior to the elastic on BB stretching that is and I think its because of the fabric on the PUL  it seems to wick more moisture than the Best Bottoms fabric on the PUL  Again I still think Best Bottoms are better  the softness and trim factor makes this acceptable to me and not a big deal since we dont have leaks often  If we do its usually my own fault for not adjusting the insert well enough or making sure the insert isnt peeking out through the gussetsIn addition to Buttons and Best Bottoms I have a Rumparooz cover a Lotus Bum cover and fleece covers  I also have fitteds which I also like a lot pocket diapers my least favorite tons of flats some prefolds  I always grab Buttons first  Always UPDATE My baby is 9 months old now and crawling all over the place  She does get slightly irritated on the tops of her thighs from the PUL that is exposed to her skin and rubs there when she moves  Once I realized this I just started tucking that part of the wing in so the outer fabric is what rubs there not the inside PUL  Simple and does the trick  Just wanted to mention this in case anyone else wanted a simple fix for this scenario\n",

      "* The joovy zoom 360 was the perfect solution for us We couldnt justify spending the money on a mountain buggy terrain but we wanted a very sturdy allterrain jogger with a locking swivel wheel I tried out a BOB as well in the store I also wanted a large sun canopy and a seat that my daughter would be able to fit in for years This stroller is affordable while still having most of the features I was looking for in a jogger The biggest compromise for me was that I had wanted a hand brake but honestly I probably dont need it This stroller is so easy to push and stop that it is unnecessaryThe fabric is sturdy and feels like it will really lastThe foot rest is far enough away from the seat that my daughter will be able to fit comfortably in the seat for several years without outgrowing it It is sturdy metal with drainage holes I didnt like the BOBs foot rest because it was made of fabricThe locking swivel wheel is easy to lock or unlock It doesnt shake when I jog I use this on the woods trails and the stroller goes right over rocks roots and small stumps without a problem The 16 rear tires are great and make for a very smooth ride The suspension is nice and springyThe canopy is AWESOME I like that it is so strong and very adjustable It also stands up well to the wind The full sun coverage is one of the reasons I picked this stroller It has two reflective strips on the front The window is large and works great The Velcro flap is held up with a toggleThe straps for the 5point harness straps are adjustable both in length and position but the shoulder straps are wide enough that my 5monthold tends to have one slip off a shoulder I think it will work perfectly as she grows They also have reflective stitching which is nice The buckle is simple for adults but hard for children It would be nice to have padding and a chest strap but I can live without itThe seat is sturdy and has lots of room for growth I can still use this stroller for a 5 or 6 yearold with no problem The weight capacity is very high compared to similar jogging strollers The seat sits up enough that a child can see out without leaning forward yet it also reclines very easily for a newborn When reclined the back of the seat is mesh which allows for good air flow To block the sun or wind I just hang a blanket over the backStorage on this stroller is great The basket on the bottom is large and can hold up to 5 pounds it says I put more than that in there just fine The back of the seat has a mesh pocket that can hold up to 3 lbs There are 2 mesh pockets on the sides in the seat for the child to use There is also an included parent console that attaches to the handlebar with four Velcro straps I like that it is not permanently attached and that it is included The cup holders are neoprene and large enough and deep enough for Nalgene bottles and the center compartment has a zippered cover The center compartment is large enough for my phone digital camera and keys with room to spareThe handlebar is not adjustable which is a bummer but it is padded with foam and is a good height for me 57 and my husband 6 1 and my sister 54 to use comfortably The runaway strap is attached to the bottom of the stroller where the storage compartment is which is great because it wont tip the stroller over if I fall down and the stroller gets away from me The strap has Velcro to attach it to itself around the handlebar for storageI havent used the rain shield because I dont tend to go jogging in the rain but I like that I have the option I am glad it is includedThe tire pump is included and has a spot to Velcro into the basket below the seat I had a hard time figuring out how to follow the directions to get the pump to work because the tube is stuck into the other end of the pump and I couldnt find it It isnt screwed in it is the brasslooking thing on the end that you can grab well enough to pull on and then it comes right out and screws into the opposite end of the pump It works very well and in no time my tires were ready to go It would be nice if there was an air pressure gauge but I cant be too picky I supposeThis stroller glides along and can be easily pushed turned and stopped with one hand even on grass or on a hill Granted my daughter is still very young but I have tried it with larger children as well and have been impressed I highly recommend this stroller I wish they made a double version\n",

      "* I did a TON of research before I purchased this stroller and I still watch stroller reviews all the time Babygizmocom has really great reviews on so many strollers And Zooper Waltz 2011 is THE BEST of all Ive seen so farLet me tell you first though that it is not an allterrain or jogging stroller and it does not have an ability to be used for more than one child So if youre looking for these things this is not it But if youre looking for a single stroller for city walking and a little bit of park and dirt etc and you dont want a monster stroller size and weight wise this is the best stroller of that kindOne of my favorite things about this stroller is that it comes with SO many accessories that are sold separately on most other strollers especially those expensive ones With this one you pay 300 I paid 250 for it on eBay and get the following accessories all included A UV netIt easily snaps onto the canopy to completely shade the front and there are two elastic loops at the bottom to attach it securely to the stroller It comes in a zippered pouch and whats genius about it is that the pouch itself is actually part of the net so you dont have to worry about ever losing the pouch A foot muff for cold weatherIt also easily snaps onto the seat This is something you dont see included with a stroller very often A removable cup holderIt can actually hold a travel mug Starbucks cup etc and not just a water bottle A snack tray for the childLarge enough to be actually practical Has a large deep cup holder that securely holds any sippy cup a bowllike section to put some snacks and two compartments in the middle A baby bumper barYou can either completely remove it or just swing it away to make it easier to get your child in and out of the stroller Infant car seat adapter strapsYou attach it to the Drings on the sides of the seat then it goes over your infant car seat and you secure it with a buckle and by tightening the strap Its not one of those big bulky frame adapters that some strollers have for infant car seat To me thats just one more thing to find a place for when youre not using it as a travel system This strap system feels very very secure and its just much more travel friendly A rain coverThe 2011 model does not come with a rain cover but thats because the improved canopy which is gigantic and fullcoverage is made of complete waterproof fabric and acts as a rain cover I love this because I dont have to worry about forgetting the rain cover at home or fiddling with it trying to put it on when it starts raining unexpectedly on the goSo only 300 with all these amazing practical accessories is absolutely the best price for its valueNow on to the stroller features Thats right I havent even started on the main stroller yet LightweightIts just under 19lbs Im petite and dont have a lot of arm muscle but I dont have any problem getting this in and out of my trunk or carrying it up a couple flights of stairs every once in a while High weight capacity of 55lbsNot that I would use it for a 55lbs child regularly but it means its that sturdy Easy to assembleIt comes in a big box and all you have to do is snap on the wheels and the canopy Super easy Took us 5 minutes However I do want to note that we attached the canopy wrong at first and because of that it ripped at the zipper when we tried to recline the seat There are four snaps on the bottom of the canopy one set at the very front on each side and another in the middle The front set snaps onto the sides of the seat and the middle ones onto the back of the seat Our mistake was attaching the front ones to the seat back But Zooper had a super nice warranty service where they sent us a brand new canopy for no charge even though it was our fault Newborn friendlyIt has a very flat recline position and the leg rest goes all the way up and securely zips on to the sides of the seat creating a bassinetlike environment The leg rest also lays flat for babies or goes down for older kids It also has an infant guard at the top of the seat that would prevent your infant from ever sliding out of the seat when the seat is fully reclined and the back of the canopy is removed But this piece can be tucked away with an attached velcro once your child gets taller It also comes with an infant head rest that is attached to the shoulder straps but this is also removable Onehanded open and fold and stands on its own when foldedNow theres a trick to doing it onehanded Its supposed to be done with two hands and its super easy to do but you can also do it onehanded To open it you unlock the lock on the side push the big button on the handle bar and instead of grabbing the small handle on the side like you would when youre opening it with two hands you just push down on the top bar of the basket with your foot To fold it first you retract the canopy and put the seat up to the upright position lock all the wheels and then push the big button on the handlebar lift up on the small handle on the side with your knee just a little nudge and then you push the whole stroller down towards the ground with the handlebar That allows the frame to slide into a folded position Then I usually have to push down on the front of the frame with my foot to engage the lock It might sound complicated but once you get the hang of it you can do it in seconds My babys been real clingy and so its been nice being able  to open and fold the stroller while holding him Fullcoverage canopy with a large viewing windowThis canopy is probably my favorite feature of this stroller First of all its huge and it folds all the way down to the bumper bar to completely shade and cover your child It has a large viewing window with a flap to cover it when not in use The flap has no noisy velcro on it so you wont have to worry about waking up your baby When the seat is fully reclined but you still want fullcoverage on your sleeping baby you can actually unzip whole another fullsized panel to do that Also theres another zipper on the canopy that you can unzip and reveal a mesh underneath the back of the canopy This enables a good airflow through the back into your child The whole back of the canopy and the mesh underneath it are both completely removable as well Great storageThe basket is huge and can fit my diaper bag another big bag with beach towels and blankets jackets water bottles and lunch fairly easily So its perfect for picnics and shopping It has a hard bottom so that you will never be dragging your stuff on the ground An amazing feature of this basket is that they put a vertical zipper on each side of the basket towards the front of the stroller that goes all the way to the bottom so you will have a complete access to the content even when the seat is fully reclined I love it I also like that the side fabric of the basket is kind of seethrough so you can see where everything isAlso there is a large pocket on the back of the canopy where I can fit my clutchsize purse and another pocket on top of it with a lid which is perfect for keeping your keys cellphones etc Theres another small pocket on the back of the seat where the warnings are supposed to go but thats where I keep my UV net and car seat adapters Onehanded bar recline that has 4 different positionsI can even adjust the recline up and down while walking with this stroller Seat fabric machinewashableThe seat fabric comes off to be machinewashed Canopy is spot clean only Excellent maneuverabilityIt pushes really well and as long as Im on a paved street I can totally push it and even turn it onehanded with the baby and tons of stuff in the basket It does pretty good on grass dirt and gravel but I usually need two hands to turn on rough terrain Carrying handle on the side and the ability to wheel behind when its foldedCarrying handle is definitely nice when I lift it up to put it in my trunk and if you have the front wheels locked you can wheel it behind you like a luggage Front swivel wheels that can also be locked straight for rougher terrain and onetouch rear brakeThis is pretty standard for most strollers but its definitely a nice feature All four wheels have suspension systemIve taken it on grass and some dirt roads and it pushed very well Padded five point harness that are height adjustableThis is pretty standard too and you do have to rethread the shoulder straps to adjust the height but you wont be adjusting them all the time so this is not an issue The paddings on the shoulder straps are easily removable The buckle is easy to do no puzzle pieces You can also detach the shoulder straps and use it as a 3 point harness once your child is old enoughAs you can tell I just cannot say enough good things about this stroller Ive been using it for almost 7 months since my son was a newborn and I absolutely love itZooper also has Bolero and Twist and the differences areBolero is 400 and comes with a bassinet kit to make the seat a real bassinet Its a tad bigger and heavier but has a more compact standing fold than WaltzTwist is 200 and has an umbrella fold It can not stand on its own when folded but everything else is the same as Waltz\n",

      "* Weve been using Britax for our boy now 14 months old since his very first moments leaving the hospital  Thankfully cost was not part of our consideration so we went with the best seat we could find  Britax has been good but I wish we had found the Pria  Its a terrific car seatThree best parts so far1  Head control2  Style3  Cup holder4  Soft easy to clean fabricHead control  My biggest concern with other car seats has been his head  When our son sleeps in the car he tilts his head to the side much like my father does now  But with my Dad I dont worry too much because he always seems to wake up after a few minutes and straighten out  But babies dont seem to do that well and Ive been concerned that hes closing off airway or blood to his head  Im not a doctor but it doesnt look good to me  Weve tried rolling his little blanket and stuffing it by his neck like an airplane pillowto no avail  He just tosses it on the seat  This seat has a great system for controlling his headStyle  This seat is attractive  We never used the infant insert but it has an elegant shape to it  The rest of the seat looks good too  I know its not a big concern but I do appreciate great designCup holder  It has a perfectly placed cup holder  We use the Uppababy stroller and it has a great tray where our son has become used to storing his cell phone and other things  Without a cup holder close to his hands in our car everything sits between his knees which makes it all tough to reach  Prias solution is perfect and I dont find myself reaching into the back seat as muchGreat fabric  We love the soft feel of this seat  Its almost like a good pillow  And the fabric has proven quite easy to cleanOverall were thrilled with the seatHope you enjoy yours tooPhilUPDATE Its been over a year now and we remain thrilled with this seat We kept the Britax so wed have an extra seat in the car for James friends to ride together with us Night and day this seat remains the hands down winner for easy buckling in easy cleaning and comfort And the cup holder continues to be the perfect place for drinks snacks or a little toy carWasnt sure this seat would make it this long as the fabric doesnt feel as tough as the Britax But it sure has Whatever they used is as easy to work with now as the day this one arrived And remains easy to clean Were having another one soon so the Britax will be moving to the middle seat to make room for another MaxiCosiAny recommendations on a new color\n",

      "* I am so incredibly disappointed with the stroller I just dont even know where to begin  First of all I have four children and have been through many strollers  This stroller hands down is the worst stroller I have ever owned  I really wanted a double stroller that was somewhat compact but that would also accommodate an infant car seat  The Aria twin claims to be able to do thisCONS So first a foremost I would NEVER place an infant car seat on this stroller  Even with a Peg Perego infant car seat it is really unsteady while on the stroller  The tray the car seat rests on is super flimsy as in worse than a super cheap 40 dollar stroller In general the entire stroller is made of really flimsy cheapo plastic With two small children in it one that weights 22 pounds and the other only 15 pounds the stroller is really difficult to steer  When attempting to turn the entire plastic frame twists and feels like it is going to brake  It feels like trying to turn with two 100 pound kids overloading the stroller It feels like a really cheapo stroller From day one the storage basket under the kids has dragged on the ground  Yes it is installed correctly  I even called Peg Perego but they said there was nothing they could do  So now it has a giant hole in it and cannot be use Since about the second week we owned the stroller the tires on the wheels of the stroller keep randomly popping off  I will be walking in the mall and hear a thumpthumpthump sound only to see a tire half hanging on tot he wheel The cup holder is worthless and will not fit anything at all except maybe a small water bottle The sun shades are really really short I had to buy extensionsPRO It does fold very compactly as in much smaller than most single strollersI really wanted to love this stroller  I kept making excuses for it but finally just gave up  At this point my husband refuses to use it  We really have been through many strollers and none are perfect  However if you are looking for a somewhat compact but nice double stroller I would recommend looking at the Baby Jogger City Mini which is what I ended up buying to replace this stroller or maybe the Combi double stroller which our friends have and seem to really enjoy  I would not waste money on the Aria twin  I spent over 300 dollars on this stroller and cant even attempt to resell it because after less than a year of use it is basically trash which is what it wound up being  I dont know about other Peg Perego products but after my experience with this stroller I can honestly say Im not going to gamble my money on the brand again\n",

      "* PLEASE HEED THE OTHER REVIEWERS WARNINGS ON THIS  I am not one to write a review but the Evenflo high chair is so dangerous and the company so negligent that I had to let others know  We have the Evenflo Majestic Highchair which has recently finally been recalled  We had issues with the screws popping out of the recliner section of the chair when we used it with our then 4 month old I called Evenflo last March they sent me a repair kit with longer screws still didnt work Customer service had told me then this was not a common problem and that even with a screw missing highchair was safe to use not dangerous Im so furious they lied about my sons safety Our longer screws did pop out a few times we put them back in I called back and since the highchair still held up fine and they told me it was okay to use we wrongly trusted Evenflo and continued to use the highchair my husband had checked it and felt is was okay I just called in response to last weeks recall and they said they do have a record of me calling sorry that happened and would I like a new set of screws They wont give a refund and the new screws which they will ship out in approx 2 weeks and recommend we dont use the highchair in the meantime supposedly work better than the original replacements I am returning this to the store and if they wont accept the return Ill have to eat the cost and throw out the chair  Weve had so many of our kids things recalled its infuriating that these companies only have to send screws that may or may not work and before their belated recalls our kids are at risk and to boot this time they assured me there was no danger Please do not buy Evenflo and know that you cant trust the info you receive from customer serviceIm am so thankful my son wasnt injured Weve had other issues with most of our Evenflo products not working correctly but all involving bells and whistles not structual I just cant understand how these companies put more money into their impossible to open packaging than into their product safety\n",

      "* My husband and I are VERY disappointed and shocked by how awful this bassinet is We ordered it because we liked the color and it looked nice and simple and it was inexpensive Well we got what we paid for1 It comes in 3 parts so you would think assembly would be a piece of cake EVERYTHING about assembling this is awful There are metal wires on the back that you have to force into these clips which is almost impossible because the wire is way too long I 10 months pregnant had to push the opposite side of the bassinet as hard as i could so my husband could try to get the wire into the clips that it comes with This took us a very long time2 Next we tried to pull the legs apart which were wedged together by all the screws and things attached3 THE CANOPY You would think this would be a sinch right The canopy wires or wine as they call them in the instructions was backwards The canonpy is so flimsy that it hardly is worthwhile Once we got the canopy wire turned around correctly we pushed as hard as possible to insert the canopy into the base and twice in about an hour the canopy already popped out which clearly poses a safety issue if there were a baby inside4 The wheels were very hard to insert to the point that they clicked in5 The instructions were obviously written by a nonEnglish speaking person Not only is the grammar horrific there are spelling errors and the instructions tell you NOTHING What does Pull forward to open pull afterward to close mean This is all that is given on how to insert the canopy Which again you would think would be self explanatory But when you are trying for 20 minutes to get it to insert and the wire is backwards you look for some sort of instruction The only instruction they do give is the obvious Again open canopy Ok thank you thats great HOW DO YOU INSERT IT PROPERLY6 Finally the color is very weird I wouldnt have even mentioned this if it wasnt so awful in every other way I thought it was going to be green but like a previous review said its blue and yellow plaid with green ruffles The sheet that comes with it is a very rough material The basket beneath seems impossible to get into as there is just a very small opening on the sides All of this I could have lived withI am so frustrated with this because we are having our baby in 3 days and the bassinet just arrived I was excited assuming we would have the bassinet in time for the baby Now it appears we are going to have to return it because it is so awfulIf we can figure out how to get this thing apart and no wonder it is out of stock everywhere no one wants to sell junk like this I was going to keep it and make do with it until the canopy continued to pop out I cant put my baby in something this unsafe And now its to the point where I am so frustrated with how poorly made this is that even though it was only 60 its the principle that I want something that will last through future children I have no idea where we are going to put our baby for the first week or so during the most exhausting period of motherhood Thanks a lot Dream on Me\n",

      "* My disappointment with this product prompted me to write to the manufacturer  Below is my correspondenceIm writing you this email to express my deep dissatisfaction with a recently purchased Graco productMy wife and I are new parents and as expected the Graco brand was quite heavily represented on many items that expectant parents needAmong other things we purchased a Graco car seat extra seat base and a Pack and PlayAt this point our daughter is only a week old the car seat has seen limited use but the Pack and Play has already been put through some paces and it is this product that I am writing to you aboutThe model we purchased was the Pack n Play Dempsey  The main reasons we chose this model were the designcolor and the fact that it had a changing table  The additional storage seemed to be a nice feature thought not something that we will probably use at this point and as it disappears when not used as a bassinet it has limited usefulnessI have quite a few reasons to be dissatisfied with this product but by far the biggest disappointment is the changing tableThe design flaws with the changing table are glaring  It is supported only on one side leaving the other side to hang across the bassinetplayard with nothing to brace it  Our daughter who is just barely 8 pounds places enough weight on the table that it dips down on the unbraced side causing her to roll over on the side  Even if placing her as far as possible over to the braced side even a few pounds of weight over the center of the table will cause it to slant and thus cause a baby to roll over to their side  As you can imagine trying to change a baby on a device like this is akin to placing them on a slide or ramp  it is not conducive  Furthermore I dont believe it to be safe as newborns do not have full control or strength in their necks and this table causes their bodies to slant underneath them  causing them to contort in uncomfortable and possibly dangerous waysYour website states that this changing table is to be used by babies up to 25 lbs  I cant possibly imagine how a child that large wouldnt cause the table to dip at even more dangerous angles  Reviewers at Babies R Us which unfortunately I didnt consult until after this product was purchased and assembled state that children as small as 5 lbs experience these same issues  In fact out of 43 reviews at the Babies R Us site almost every other one speaks of issues that people have found with this table  The overall review as of this writing is 33 out of 5 stars which equates to 67  I wouldnt expect my daughter to bring home grades like that once she enters school  and you should find such ratings for your products absolutely unacceptableWhat is even more disappointing is that this could have easily been averted had the table been given a similar design on both sides  A couple inches of plastic leg support on the floating side of the table could have braced it against the frame and completely avoided this issue  How could something like this even have made it past your design and quality control divisionsWhile the changing table situation is enough to sour me on this product I must also mention briefly some other problems with the productThe small sound machine that comes with this model plays at such a low volume that you can legitimately not hear here it in all but the quietest room  Standing 3 feet from the crib the sound couldnt be heard over a lower than normal conversational tone  While I understand there could be safety issues from glaring sounds this device errs way to far on the side of caution to be unusable  We have plenty of other noise making baby toys which dont suffer from these issues  If the baby is quiet enough to be able to hear these sounds they are most likely already asleep in a quiet room and dont need to be soothedI was also very surprised that the mobile was not electric  While your site does not specifically state the Babies R Us site which I have no doubt Graco writes andor approves the copy states as a feature Electronics module and mobile  This misleading combination of the two features infers that the mobile is indeed electronic and therefore would move of its own power  Not only does the mobile not move on its own its design is such that spinning it by hand causes it to move around maybe on 34 revolutions 23 seconds before the friction of its design causes it to stop  It is also placed at such a level that it would never be reachable at all by a child to play with or spin on its own perhaps from a safety issue that is best  So instead of a functional mobile what the child gets is the opportunity to stare at the feet of a few stationary turtlesWhile not incredible difficult to assemble the included instructions are poorly designed at best and misleading of incorrect at worst  I probably could have assembled the device in shorter order without referring to the instructions  For example why instruct the installation of the mattress in the bottom of the unit and then go back to instruct that it must be removed in order to configure the bassinet  Wont most people be assembling and using this as a bassinet first until their child grows into the playardI also find the advertising of these products as portable pack and plays a little absurd  While you can certainly collapse them to a smaller size the ability to fit them back into their original carriers is not an easy affair  Forget about trying to disassemble the accessories  snapping apart the mobile or attempting to remove the metal frame from the changing table fabric would certainly cause damage to these parts after several times  Additionally while my wife certainly is getting better muscle tone carting around a new child your prevalent advertisements with the mother toting the collapsed playard in one hand as if it were an empty picnic basket is patently absurdUnfortunately these last few complaints about the model seem to be inherent in most all of your Pack n Play models and as such I dont believe that returning this Dempsey model for another Graco playard would really make much of a difference  I suppose I could trade it for a cheaper model with no storage or changing table but the time and effort involved isnt worth the 6075 that would be saved  To be honest I am surprised based on the quality of this product that Graco has established such a reputation and large market share in the playard departmentI certainly wont be recommending these products in the future  Additionally I will be placing this review on both Amazon and the Babies R Us website  I invite you to answer these concerns at least in those forums should you choose not to respond to them hereThank you for your time but no thank you for the productSincerelyA Disappointed Customer\n",

      "* I had to return this stroller for three reasons1 Straps are too small and my 15 month old who is average size2 The pictured armrest is not included3 Customer service phone numbers are disconnected I finally reached someone and our conversation was ended abruptly with a strange BEEEEP when I was in midsentence The person was nice enough to email photos of the straps since they assumed customers are idiots and I did not have them adjusted to maximum length before I made the callAllow me to go into detail about these straps First of all they are too small to fit any toddler The design of the seat and straps are not intuitive and it seems like the straps were an afterthought When fully expanded the straps just barely fit my daughter and I took her out of the stroller immediately because she was visibly uncomfortable I adjusted the shoulder height strap to the highest passage which is not easy to do and expanded the straps fully The clasp which attaches to the seat is positioned too far back and if moved forward would provide more room The measurements are completely off and it seems like they did not have any reasonable testing to support a 55 pound limit on this stroller I was very disappointed that I could not use this stroller after I spent the money and now all this time unpacking it and putting it together Now Ive spent even more time disassembling repacking sealing and requesting a return through Amazon What funBesides the straps issue the stroller is well made The seat fabric is quality The metal frame seems to be sturdy and the wheels although plastic are ready to ride I didnt have the opportunity to push my daughter but it glides smoothly with no weight in the seat The cupholder is nice but attaches to the frame of the stroller in an awkward position Another afterthought in their 34design34 process When I was putting the stroller together the little Zooper sticky logo came off the side of the frame which covered a screw hole It was just barely hanging on there with some sort of lame adhesive I tried to stick it back on but I expect it will fall off again soonSo I called the toll free customer service phone numbers on all of the printed materials and packing sheets which were in the box I reached a call center and the woman who answered had a heavy accent and no idea what I was talking about when I asked for Zooper customer service One number was out of service I tried the third number and the person who answered seems surprised at my phone call He was helpful but I dont think he really understood the seat design as I was explaining how the straps were already extended Its difficult to communicate this problem over the phone He mentioned that 34someone else34 had received a stroller with short straps Well why are they still selling this defective product He took my information and said they would be mailing a set of longer straps for the stroller We were disconnected suddenly I would hate to assume he hung up on me I was pleasant and accommodating to his request for information so he could help me I stated on the phone that I was considering returning the stroller because I cant use it and I was unhappy with the product Thats when the call ended I didnt have a chance to mention the armrest while on the phone but I responded to the email with a picture of this Amazon listing and said the armrest was not included That was 11 days ago and I have still not received the longer straps I have a feeling they arent coming and now Im just angry about the entire situation This is why I order on Amazon if I had purchased directly from this company I have a feeling Id never get a refund eitherThats about the size of it Im returning the stroller this week and spending a few more dollars to get the Joovy We needed a stroller three weeks ago this one is useless and Im tired of looking at it I paid 16589 for a hassle I still cant believe it cost 1789 to ship this piece of garbage but thats what it cost I expect a FULL refund\n",

      "* We bought this stroller after selling our beloved BOB rev on craigslist We used the BOB for 9 months for my son but it just wasnt practical I dont jogrun it didnt have a big basket and was very bulky to take into stores quickly However I did love how it unfolded easily but it was heavy to fold up and lift into my small trunk myself Overall I didnt realize what Id need in a stroller until AFTER I had my son Live  learn We did love how easily the BOB would go over pretty much anything Nevertheless we sold it and after extensive research on strollers we decided it was between the uppababy brand because of the large baskets OR the city mini GT because of its easy fold up design After looking over both strollers I decided on the uppababy cruz because of a few main factors It SITS UP I cant tell you how much my son hates being reclined when he is just riding in the stroller and not napping The BOB and the City Mini had a slight recline and he always tried sitting more upright The uppababy sits up like your sitting in a chair He loves it It also reclines nearly flat The foot rest can be positioned upwards so that its as if he is sitting on the floor because he is so upright and his feet are out in front of him Also the LARGE basket was a HUGE plus I cant tell you how great evvvvverything fits in there Its perfect and soooo easily accessable The city mini gt did NOT have a big enough basket for me and there for was not the right choice for me despite the very easy fold up The true test for us was this past weekend when we took it to Maine on a camping trip YES it is no BOB However I thought it was just fine over the rough bumps of a campground Bumpy ride Yes But nothing my 10 month old couldnt handle and honestly It wasnt that bad We took it to old orchard beach and as I suspected it didnt roll over the sand like my good old BOB did But it rolls really nicely on pavement and I just carried my son over to the beach and I figure he will be 1 soon enough and walking so I wont need the stroller on the beach anyways I also love the reversable seat that comes in handy because my son is going through some sort of attachment to mommy thing so he likes being able to face me from time to time I also love that the Cruz is a less expencive option to the Vista The vista is much much heavier and a little bigger And since we didnt need the extras that the Vista comes with this was the better option for us Also I called Uppababy and asked about a belly bar and toddler board for the cruz and they told me that BOTH would be available The belly bar will be out this summer and the board is in producton huge plus So for us this stroller was a hit but as anything goes you MUST research what YOU need in a stroller and figure out whats important to you Some people dont care about a big basket and in that case id for sure go with the City mini gtUPDATE1713We are in LOVE with this stroller still It fits great in the trunk of my saturn ion and how I fold it is I take the seat off first takes 1 second and then fold the frame I found it fits and folds better that way plus some times my son likes to sit forward and sometimes backwards still so I just set up the frame and then throw the seat on top depending on which way i think he wants to sit The basket is just my fave feature I cant tell you how happy I have been with the uppababby My son is 16 months old and loves sitting in his uppababy well worth it still\n",

      "* We love this highchair  We have a 4 year old and an 8 month old  This is our 3rd highchairFeatures we loveFit  This chair FITS my infant daughter  She fits in this chair without the extra insert way better than in the basic Evenflo chair we had before  I only use the 3point harness and let her shoulders be free and she sits at a correct level so her arms can move around well and she can lean and reach for things on the tray  Many other chairs have a real problem with fit  So I do believe that with the insert this is the perfect chair to start your 4 month infant in for feeding  The insert will make them more secure kind of like their carseatTray Insert  With our other chairs the tray clicks down into the larger tray all the way aroundyou can remove it for cleaning  Fine  But I always hated that food got into the crack nearest to the baby so I couldnt just wipe it downI HAD to remove it to get out all the gunk  The tray on this is so smartthe edge closest to the baby wraps all the way down and clicks under the lip of the large trayone smooth surface where all the food is landing  I love itUpholstry  I love this leather look  It cleans easy and is really cushy  The part that is designed to match other Graco gear is just an insert for small infants  The rest of it is just a tan color and it matches anythingSturdiness  I cant tell you how much safer I feel my daughter is in thisit is solid  I never felt terribly comfortable reclining her in other seats but this one is made well and I am not worriedVersitality  This is one of the best parts  We bought this and now we are using both the highchair for our 8 month old daughter and the booster for our 4 year old son  Here is how it works  Basically it is like a high chair with 2 bases  Both bases are toddler chairs themselves  I will call them the rolling base and the chair base  So you have a toddler seat attached to the rolling base and another toddler seat that you can attach with straps to a chair the chair base  Then you can take the separate highchair part and click it into the rolling base or to the chair base whichever you like  Then the unused base becomes a toddler chair  One might think that you could sit 3 children2 toddlers in the bases and then an infant in the highchair part but the highchair really needs to click into a base because it is not designed to be on its own  The highchair with the chair base would be great to take when traveling especially if you just use the snack tray and leave the large tray at home  And the toddler seat that is attached to the highchair frame is truly good for getting under tables with a lip because of its low sides unlike many toddler seats that come up too far and you cant scoot them under the tableWorth notingI see no problem with the snack tray  At 8 months my daughter fits fine and it is half as big as the traya great size snack tray  And it has its own separate cup holder  You really dont need the snack tray before they start feeding themselves so I cant see it being a problem at the age you would need itAdjustable foot rest  I just love this and it just makes it better for the baby to have more support  My 8 month old cant touch the highest setting yet but probably within 6 months or soToddler seat  I thought it was extra great that they include an adjustable backthere are 3 slots to put slide a back into the chairthat way you can match the length of the chair to your childs legs  My 4 year old is big enough that we removed the back and let him sit all the way back in order that is knees bend in the right place  But I can see where this would be a great feature for perfect fit through the yearsThis really is a great chair for every possible use infant toddler preschooler traveling having an extra seat if you have other kids over to your house  The system will seat 2 children at once 1 baby with tray and 1 older child OR 2 older childrenWe love thisworth every penny\n",

      "* UPDATE 112013  I went ahead and used a tiny bit of WD40 and also thoroughly cleaned the carseat base and stroller and all the mechanisms started working like new again  No more issues opening or closing the stroller and no more issues getting the seat out of the baseMy child was finally moved out of this seat at 14 months and placed in a transitional carseat rear facing of course and I sold the entire system on craigs list for 150 including two bases  For something I got so much use out of to be able to resell it for that amount of money is unheard of  I even had people offering me more after I had already sold it  So I am now convinced this was a very smart purchase and I sure got a lot of use out this travel system  I am not going to lie I was almost tearful seeing it go to a

to all the use we use this thing a lot and it has been on a lot of plane rides but the mechanism is frustrating now  I am going to try some WD40 soon to see if that will help3 My kid is 11 months old and still uses it so that is a BONUS  Yeah a break from buying more car seats for a while  He is  big kid too4 The mechanism for getting the car seat out of the base is kind of tricky now too  Most of the times it is fine but some days I dont think I will ever get it to unlatchI still like it but for the price tag I would get a Britax stroller and infant car seat combo in the future if I ever have more childrenI am a 3rd time mom but it has been 5 years since my last baby  I wanted a car seat with a stroller that would be easy to use by myself and would be easy to install in the car  I also wanted a one with a good safety rating  So after reading multiple reviews and consumer reports on many different travel systems I found this one and went ahead and took the plunge site unseen they dont carry Chicco at our local walmart and I live hours away from a store that does  My baby is now 5 weeks old and I have been using the heck out of the system so here is what I think so farCar seat prosThe car seat is EASY take in and out of the base  I had a Graco Snuggleride with my last one and I thought that was easy but the Chicco blows it away  It was also super easy to install in my car and in my SUV  The clips to attach to the LATCH system and really easy to use and the level makes it easy to know you have a the proper angle for the seat  It was much more difficult with the Graco seat that is for sure  The straps are easy to use and adjust and the car seat looks very nice and stylish  I got the Miro patterned fabric and it is lovely and gender neutral which was a big deal to me because this was a surprise baby  It just looks and feels to be of high qualityCar seat consThis seat is heavy I carry it a lot but I always opt to use the stroller with the car seat it I am going to be walking any short distance because the seat with my baby just seems like a lot to lug around  I know my Graco one wasnt this heavy  Also it doesnt fit into a shopping cart very easily making shopping with baby without the assistance of another person pretty difficult  I finally started just carrying my infant son with my baby Ktan and leaving the car seat in the car  Now you can turn the car seat sideways on top of the cart or fit it in the actual cart but that leaves little room for anything else and there is safety issues too  So if you are a single parent or dont have a lot of help with going grocery shopping this could be a concern for you while baby is small and cant sit up by themselvesStroller prosFirst off I LOVE this stroller  I have NEVER had a stroller that is so easy to use and pushes through any terrain with such ease  I keep this stroller in the back of my vehicle at all times and I pull it out and use it so much  I can easily open this stroller with one hand and fold it with one hand  That is literally unheard of in stroller land even with a cheap little umbrella stroller  I have taken this stroller on a nature path full of uneven rocky terrain without a hiccup it rides so smooth  The car seat fits in so easily to the stroller making it basically effortless to get going even when I have 2 older boys and a infant get around by myself  Also I am on the tall side 59 for a girl and I love the adjustable height of the handle  no longer will I kill my back pushing a stroller  I know when my kiddo outgrows the car seat we will still use this stroller for a few years  It has a nice big basket at the bottom multiple drink holders a snack tray and a small item tray for the parent too  I have honestly used this stroller way more than I used the Graco one the entire time I owned it  I think this stroller really makes the travel system  The car seat itself is great but the stroller really takes this system to another level  Did I mention how easy it is to open and fold the stroller and you can do it with one hand  Seriously I cant say enough about this strollerStroller consThe only con I can find right now is that this stroller is massive  I have a Honda Pilot and it takes up a good chunk of my back storage areaand that is saying something  Someone with a smaller vehicle would probably need to see the stroller folded to tell if they are going to have room for it in their vehicleAll in all this is a great system for myself but I dont think it would work for everyone with the weight of the car seat and how big the stroller is  Probably be best to view and get your hands on the system in person before buying\n",

      "* My wife and I were looking for a monitor for our second son and we thought this one looked pretty good We read some great reviews and decided to get it It is a waste of money The Out of Range alarm beeps regularly when I am in the same house less than 75 ft away from our son Its nice to have the rechargeable battery but other than that this is really a waste Our house isnt huge but its big enough to present a problemOur other son had a monitor that wasnt available where we purchased this one we moved recently and we love that one The range is amazing 200 ft I took our trash to the dumpster and I was still able to hear my mother and wife talking in it We lived in seminary housing and the walls were concrete so thats amazing The Sony doesnt even work in our current house with regular wallsConsidering that this is made from a decent company we are very disappointed with the way it turned out I hope someone will read this review and not purchase this monitorI wish we had read enough negative reviews to stay away from it A waste of money\n",

      "* I received this glider and it was broke and wood was chipped off on the seat  It looked like it was poorly packaged since the two glider bases were side by side without foam between them  Amazon would not let me choose a preprinted return label as one of my options for return  I could only take it to UPS  The box was huge and heavy and very difficult to transport  It cost 86 to return well over the 34 Amazon said they would reimburse  I am now waiting to see if I will get the full amount refunded when my return was recieved by Amazon  I was very unhappy with what I had to go through when the chair was broken when received\n",

      "* I searched for Baby Blanket Made in the USA and the Manual Woodworkers Tiny Talks Travel Blanket showed as a result  I was very excited and added it to my registry  I was also very excited when I opened the gift but was soon very disappointed to see that although is says clearly and in large print on the actual blanket Made in the USA the tag on the blanket says Made in China  I was disgusted  I understand if the manufacturer was stating that the baby is made in the USA but really it wouldnt be difficult to actually manufacture this blanket in the USA and really have something to be proud of  Plenty of companies manufacture blankets in the USA and they are excellent quality and a great value with a low priceAnimals on the Farm Baby Blanket  Made in the USASheetWorld Fitted Crib  Toddler Sheet  Monster Trucks Blue  Made In USAIt can be done and I am disappointed in this companys false advertising  When I tried to return the product out of principal I received a confused response from the seller about how they dont understand Amazons return policy and I was unable to respond to that message  I have been very disappointed in Amazons ease of returns from third party suppliers  I will not be purchasing items through Amazon that are from a third party supplier any more  I have also been completely disgusted with Amazons customer service online  It is too bad the item could be a real winner if it had just actually been made in the USA or at least the online description could have stated that it was manufactured in China\n",

      "* I loved all the features of the car seat  It is an awesome car seat and you could take it from one car to another and adjust from rearfacing infant to forward facing 4 yo in a minute or two  The features are awesomeI purchased this about a week ago  Although I loved the ease of use for me I was unhappy with my 2 yos posture  regardless of the incline used  I decided to return it  As a PT Im particular about posture  The back of the seat is more curved than out Chicco key fit with the legs slightly elevated and therefore creating a rounded postureI was SHOCKED  when I went to return the item purchased through AMAZON LLC  that I couldnt print a return label  Turns out this is a NON returnable item  Its not that you would even have to pay for the return shipping  you cant return it AT ALL  I even double checked and the vendor was definitely AMAZON  Not an outside VendorAs someone who buys thousands of dollars worth of stuff directly from Amazon I was really surprised  Ive never encountered anything like this and Ive returned things in the past  It is usually very simpleI dont think there was any warning when I bought it that it was non returnable  I definitely cant find any sort of warning on product page nowDouble check with the vendor before you buy this if you think there is even the slightest chance you will want to return it\n",
